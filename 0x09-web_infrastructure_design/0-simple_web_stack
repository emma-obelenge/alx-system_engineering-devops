Issues
7. What is the server using to communicate with the computer of the user requesting the website: The server communicates using the HTTP protocol.


ISSUES WITH THE INFRASTRUCTURE
A. SPOF (Single Point Of Failure): There are numerous single points of failure, starting from having a single server containing only one web server, application server, and database. A single point of failure refers to a component of a system whose failure would halt the entire system's operation.

B. Downtime during maintenance (such as deploying new code requiring web server restart): The downtime period might exceed expectations due to the server's dependency on a single codebase that is temporarily unavailable. Consequently, users will be unable to access the website and its content, resulting in a poor user experience and loss of traffic.

C. Inability to scale with increased traffic: Directly pointing the domain name to the server without a load balancer makes handling increased loads difficult. This presents a challenge in managing the volume of users attempting to access the website's content and may lead to a degraded user experience or impose a limit on the number of users the website can accommodate.
