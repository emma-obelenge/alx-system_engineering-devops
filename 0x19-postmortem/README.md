# Postmortem Guide

This section details how to create an Incident Report, often referred to as a Postmortem, using a structure similar to that followed by Google engineers. The report consists of five key sections: **Issue Summary**, **Timeline**, **Root Cause Analysis**, **Resolution and Recovery**, and **Corrective and Preventative Measures**. Below is a breakdown of each section.

## Issue Summary
- Provide a brief summary (around 5 sentences).
- Include the duration, with start and end times (specify the timezone).
- Describe the impact (e.g., "Most user requests resulted in 500 errors, with 100% impact at peak time").
- End with the root cause.

## Timeline
- Specify the timezone.
- Document the duration of the outage.
- Note when the outage began.
- Record when staff were notified.
- Outline key actions and events.
- Indicate when service was restored.

## Root Cause
- Offer a detailed explanation of what happened.
- Be transparent—don’t minimize the issue.

## Resolution and Recovery
- Detail the actions taken to resolve the issue, including specific times.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures
- List the steps to prevent future occurrences.
- Reflect on what can be improved moving forward.
